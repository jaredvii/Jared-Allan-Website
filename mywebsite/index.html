        <h2>Learning Web Development Isn't Always Easy</h2><br>
        <p> However, that's something that can quickly change with the right program and instructors. 
        I for example didn't know the first thing about programming until just a few weeks ago when I enrolled in a software development program by
        <a href="https://www.correlation-one.com/">Correlation One</a>.
        This program has taught me all of the HTML basics so far and now we are beginning to learn CSS. It really is so much easier than I had ever imagined         and without knowing about programs like this I never would have thought this would be possible. Anyone is able to do this including yourself! If             you're someone like me who had thought about pursuing web development or programming as a new career path but didn't know how to start for the               longest time then this is your calling!

        <h2>HTML is Extremely Fun</h2><br>
        <p> Learning HTML has probably been the most fun I've had in a long time while trying to learn something new. The instructors and TAs have made it           so easy that almost all of the stress of learning and successfully completing the assignments is gone. Now that we're wrapping up the HTML section           of the course, I feel more than comfortable with my basic knowledge of the markup language. There are also some additional websites and resources           that our instructors have mentioned to us so we can continue to learn even more after they have finished the sections. One of my absolute favorite           websites to broaden my knowledge is 
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a>.
        They have everything you can imagine on their website for curious programmers like me. Be sure to check it out if you're interested in learning             HTML!</p>

        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p class="p-not"> Hello everyone.<br>
        As I mentioned before my name is Jared Allan. I am an entry level programmer<br>
        and someone who loves to learn new things. Due to that fact I have set out to<br>
        learn at least five new things each year. Sometimes that can be challenging of<br>
        course, but if you pace yourself and find the learning methods that work best for<br>
        you the task will become less daunting. The reason I created this website was to<br>
        share with all of you what I am able to learn in my personal life. As I come across<br>
        fun or interesting new pieces of informating revolving around the programming<br>
        world I will post them here to share with you. Feel free to reach out to me<br>
